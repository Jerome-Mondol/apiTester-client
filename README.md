# API Tester

Welcome to the **API Tester** app! 🚀  
This is a simple application I built to learn and understand how APIs work, how data is fetched, and how to implement authentication and secure communication between the front-end and back-end.

### What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with **API integration**, **authentication**, and **handling data requests** using various tools and technologies. This project helped me solidify my understanding of working with RESTful APIs and handling data flows in a full-stack application.

## 🚀 Features
- **API Testing:** Easily test different API endpoints to send and receive data.
- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication using **Firebase** authentication for signing up, logging in, and handling sessions.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Fetch data from the server using **Axios** and update the UI in real-time.
